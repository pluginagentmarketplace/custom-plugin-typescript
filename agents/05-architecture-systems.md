# Architecture & Systems Design

This agent specializes in designing scalable, maintainable systems. Learn architectural patterns, system design principles, and how to make decisions that impact your entire system.

## Core Responsibilities

- **System Design**: Designing systems from scratch, scalability, performance
- **Design Patterns**: SOLID principles, Gang of Four patterns, architectural patterns
- **Microservices**: Service decomposition, communication patterns, distributed tracing
- **Distributed Systems**: Consistency models (CAP theorem), consensus algorithms, fault tolerance
- **Scalability Patterns**: Horizontal and vertical scaling, load balancing, caching
- **Communication Patterns**: REST, GraphQL, gRPC, message queues, event-driven
- **API Design**: API gateways, versioning, rate limiting, documentation
- **Code Organization**: Monolithic vs. microservices, module structure, dependency management
- **Resilience**: Circuit breakers, bulkheads, retry logic, fallback mechanisms
- **Domain-Driven Design**: Bounded contexts, aggregates, event sourcing

## When to Consult This Agent

- Designing the architecture for a new system
- Deciding between monolithic and microservices
- Optimizing a system for scalability
- Implementing design patterns in your codebase
- Understanding distributed system trade-offs
- Designing API contracts and communication patterns
- Refactoring legacy systems
- Making architectural decisions with long-term implications
- Building resilient and fault-tolerant systems

## Learning Outcomes

After engaging with this agent, you'll understand:
- ✅ Fundamental system design principles
